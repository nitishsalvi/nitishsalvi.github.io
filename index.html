    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <img src="../images/portrait-nitish-salvi.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">
        <p>I am a student at the University of Rhode Island pursuing my education in two vectors. I am a Computer Science (B.S) and Economics (B.A) double major. Alongside this I have two minors in Cybersecurity and Marketing. As a student, I strive to enhance my skills and knowledge each day and apply these skills in my everyday life. Some hobbies I enjoy are going to the gym, building legos, playing guitar, and coding.</p>
    </div>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Throughout high school and my collegiate career I strive to achieve greatness in all forms. Whether it is as a Leader, Scholar, or just a Student I want to be the best version I can be.</p>
            <h4>Certifications</h4>
            <p>As of 1/1/2024: </p>
            <p>Mental Health First Aid for Adults Certified</p>
            <p>QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) Suicide Prevention Certified</p>
            <h4>Theta Xi Fraternity</h4>
            <p>As a heavily involved member of the Theta Xi Fraternity at the University of Rhode Island I was able to develop my leadership and scholastic skills. The Theta Xi Chapter at URI is known to have the highest fraternity GPA for the past 9 semesters. By surrounding myself with like-minded individuals and having others to help motivate me I have been able to make Dean's List for 2 out of the past 3 semesters with no intentions of missing it for another semester. Alongside this, I have been able to enhance my leadership skills.</p>
                <h5>Rising Stars Academy</h5>
                <p>Rising Stars Academy is a leadership summit ran by the National Theta Xi Organization. This is an opportunity where a recently initiated member is able to go on a retreat to help build national relations, improve current standings, and develop my skills as a leader. </p>
                <h5>Mental Health Chair</h5>
                <p>As the Mental Health Chair, I was able to be a resource for other members of the Theta Xi. I was included in many summits held by URI to learn about improving mental health and helping people overcome adversities in life. Some accomplishments I achieved during this time are getting QPR trained and Mental Health First Aid (for adults) trained. These skills have let me succeed as a well respected peer in both greek life and around campus.</p>
                <h5>Chapter Vice President</h5>
                <p>The Vice President role within Theta Xi is the main role for all interfraternal proceedings. This includes making all 19 committees run smoothly. Some of our most successful committees under my leadership are philanthropy, professional development, finance, and scholarship. A large part of the role is also being the head of our Standards/J-Board in which we mediate and adjudicate disputes between members, hear charges against members who may have violated fraternity policies, and determine disciplinary actions for violations.</p>
            <h4>Language Proficiency</h4>
            <p>Throughout my career as a learner, I have been able to use the following languages: Python, C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS</p>

        <h3>Project 1 - This Website</h3>
        <p>I used HTML as the base, CSS to add more details surrounding the appearance, and JavaScript to increase the capacity of the UI. The process of making this website with no prior HTML background was tricky but here we are! Though this project is simple, it has taught me a lot about the interactions between multiple codespaces and languages to create one product.</p>
